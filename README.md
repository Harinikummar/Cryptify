<h1>CRYPTIFY - ENCRYPT AND DECRYPT EVERYTHING<h1>

<h1>About Cryptify<h1>
Cryptify is a secure file encryption and decryption platform that leverages Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and AES-256 to provide strong, efficient, and scalable protection for sensitive files.

Upon user registration, Cryptify generates a unique public-private key pair using ECC, ensuring secure key exchange. The platform utilizes the ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) method to derive a shared symmetric key, which is then used for file encryption and decryption through the AES-256 algorithm.

<h2>Key features of Cryptify include:<h2>
- Strong encryption with AES-256 for file protection.
- Secure key exchange using ECC for enhanced security with minimal computational overhead.
- User-friendly interface for file encryption and decryption.
- Modern cryptographic standards to safeguard sensitive data.
  
Cryptify is designed for anyone who values privacy and data security, making encryption both simple and highly secure.
